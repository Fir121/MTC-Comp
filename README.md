# MTC Competition Repo 

Task: Clone a website after being provided a pdf!

**View the website at [this link](https://fir121.github.io/MTC-Comp/index.html)**

Will be viewed best on a desktop/laptop/PC. Very little support for mobile, has bare minimum responsivity.
Scroll-Effects are handled by an external module, they are not available on mobile devices.

*If the above link does not work on your device you may try [this link](https://fir121.github.io/MTC-Comp/index_without_scroll.html).*
